# Module 13 Challenge

## Module 13 Challenge <assignment>

### Cloud Security

Over the last week, you created a highly available web server for XCorp's Red Team to use for testing and training. Now, your lead cloud administrator has asked for a diagram of the Network that you created to keep for documentation and company records. Your task is to use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create a detailed diagram of your cloud infrastructure.

### Cloud Recap

Once you've completed all of the cloud week activities, you should have:

- A total of three VMs running DVWA.

- All three VMs receiving traffic from your load balancer.

If you did not set up the third (optional) VM, you should have:

- A total of two VMs running DVWA.

- Both VMs receiving traffic from your load balancer.

You can complete this assignment with either two or three VMs.

### Your Goal

When you are finished with this assignment, you should have a network diagram that shows your entire cloud setup, including your Ansible jump box and the Docker containers running on each VM.

You can use this document as part of a portfolio to demonstrate your ability.

### Instructions

Use a free account at [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to diagram the entire cloud network that you created this week.

- Your diagram should show the following:
    - Azure resource group
    - Virtual network with IP address range
    - Subnet range
    - Flow of specific traffic (e.g., HTTP, SSH)
    - Security group blocking traffic
    - Load balancer
    - All four VMs that you have launched
    - Where Docker and Ansible are deployed

### Submission Guidelines

* Save your draw.io diagram to Google Drive, and title it with the following format: < YOUR NAME >< Cloud Security >
* Make sure to set the file permissions so that anyone can view and comment on your document.
* Submit the URL of your diagram through Canvas.

### Plagiarism Disclaimer

It is your responsibility to include a note in the READ ME section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstances in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.
