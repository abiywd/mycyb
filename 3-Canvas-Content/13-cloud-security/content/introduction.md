# Introduction to Module 13

## Introduction to Module 13

### Cloud Security and Virtualization

The Cloud Security and Virtualization module will introduce cloud computing service models, cloud networking, firewalls, and virtual computing.

Over the next four classes, we will build a basic cloud network using VMs and containers.

### What to Be Aware Of

:warning: This week's lessons are cumulative, meaning that each day's work builds on the previous day's. Therefore, you cannot miss a day and continue on to the next lesson without getting caught up. If you miss one of the four days, you will need to let the instructional staff know so they can help you prepare for the rest of the week.

> **Important:** During this module's classes, you will need to generate SSH keys. If you are using a Windows machine, you should have downloaded and installed [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) on your machine. You'll use GitBash to follow all SSH instructions.

### This Week’s Lab Environment

For the majority of this module's demonstrations and activities, you will use Microsoft Azure cloud services and the Azure cloud portal.

- Note that you will **not** use any of the Azure lab environments. Instead, you will use your personal Azure account.

- You should have already created a free account on [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) **before** the beginning of class. Please make sure you are signed into your own personal Azure account and **not** the lab environments.

- Refer to the [Setup Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gs_09b7eotl7hzTL82xlqPt-OwOd0aWA78qcQxtMr6Y/edit?usp=sharing) and [Azure Free Tier FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-faq/) if needed.


### Preview This Week’s Challenge

For this week's Challenge, you'll use draw.io to create a detailed diagram of the cloud infrastructure that you've created over the last week.

### Looking Forward

Next week is our first Project Week!
