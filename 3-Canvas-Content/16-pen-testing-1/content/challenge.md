# Module 16 Challenge

## Module 16 Challenge <assignment>

There is no Challenge assignment this week. Instead, you will complete a penetration testing report compiling your findings from Module 16 and Module 17 and submit it as the Module 17 challenge.  

### Plagiarism Disclaimer

It is your responsibility to include a note in the READ ME section of your repo specifying code source and its location within your repo. This applies if you have worked with a peer on an assignment, used code which you did not author or create sourced from a forum such as Stack Overflow, or you received code outside curriculum content from support staff such as an Instructor, TA, Tutor, or Learning Assistant. This will provide visibility to grading staff of your circumstances in order to avoid flagging your work as plagiarized.

If you are struggling with a challenge or any aspect of the curriculum, please remember there are student support services available for you:

* Ask the class Slack channel/ peer support
