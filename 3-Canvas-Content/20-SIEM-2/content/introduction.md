# Introduction to Module 20

## Introduction to Module 20

### SIEM 2

In the second of the SIEM modules, we will continue learning about the many features and functions Splunk provides to security professionals.

The week will include:

- On Day 1, we will build on the topics that we covered in the previous module, creating visualizations and dashboards to better understand an organization's security posture.
- On Day 2, we will explore the advanced security monitoring products that security professionals use.
   - We will also introduce the various certifications that Splunk offers, and career paths that use the skills we've learned in these two modules. You'll start your first Splunk certification: Splunk Fundamentals 1.
   - Day 2 will conclude with an introduction to the two remaining course projects and the optional **Demo Day** project.

### What to Be Aware Of

The Splunk Certification activity on Day 2 requires signing up for Splunk's Fundamentals 1 certification training. It may take 5&ndash;10 minutes to get access to the training module after successfully registering. If the training doesn't start after registration, wait up to 10 minutes and try starting the training module again.
